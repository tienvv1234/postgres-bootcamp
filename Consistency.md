### Consistency
- Consistency in Data
    - Defined by the user
    - Referential integrity(foreign key constraints)
    - Atomicity
    - Isolation
- Consistency in reads
    - If a transaction committed a change, will a new transaction immediately see the change?
    - Affects the system as a whole
    - Relational and NoSQL databases suffer from this
    - Eventual consistency
